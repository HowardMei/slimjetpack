# Slim JP
===========
Accept minor pull requests for security, bugfix or maintenance purpose.
Slim JP will keep updating as a maintenance solution for existing SlimJetpack users.
New users are recommended to use the official JetPack plugin.

## Description

If you've been using those offline modules previously published as separate plugins and now integrated into [Jetpack](http://jetpack.me/), give Slim JP a try.

If you're users of SlimJetpack, then you should replace it with Slim JP. Deactivate it and install this manually.

According to the new trademark policy of Automattic and the suggestion from JetPack developer George, I decided to
deprecate the SlimJetpack at wordpress.org/plugins/slimjetpack/.

I'm developing a new plugin "HandsomeWP" to replace Slim JP and add more features for better user experience.
The "HandsomeWP" will be published on wordpress.org/plugins/ if it's ready.

Sorry for the inconvenience!
